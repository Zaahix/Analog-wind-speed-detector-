# Analog-wind-speed-detector-
Designed a low-cost analog wind speed indicator using a DC motor as sensor, LM324 op-amp for signal amplification, and Arduino Uno for processing. Wind speed–dependent voltage was measured, converted using ADC, and indicated using LEDs and a relay based on a preset cutoff speed.
