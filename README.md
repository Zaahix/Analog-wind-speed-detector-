# Analog Wind Speed Indicator using LM324 and Arduino Uno

## Description
This project implements a low-cost analog wind speed indicator using a DC motor as a wind sensor, LM324 operational amplifier for signal conditioning, and Arduino Uno for processing. The voltage generated by the motor is proportional to wind speed and is amplified before being read by the Arduino ADC. LEDs and a relay are triggered based on a preset cutoff speed.

## Objectives
- To design a simple and cost-effective wind speed measurement system  
- To interface analog signal conditioning with a microcontroller  
- To demonstrate wind-speed-based indication and control  

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- LM324 Operational Amplifier  
- DC Toy Motor (used as wind sensor)  
- Relay Module (5V)  
- Red and Green LEDs  
- Resistors and Capacitor  
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires  

## Working Principle
- The DC motor acts as a generator and produces voltage proportional to wind speed  
- The LM324 op-amp amplifies the low-level analog voltage  
- Arduino Uno reads the amplified signal using its ADC  
- Based on a preset cutoff speed:
  - Green LED indicates safe/low wind
  - Red LED and relay activate at higher wind speeds  

## Features
- Analog signal conditioning using op-amp  
- ADC-based wind speed measurement  
- Visual (LED) and electrical (relay) indication  
- Low-cost and easy-to-build design  

## Applications
- Weather monitoring systems  
- Environmental sensing projects  
- Automation and safety systems  
- Academic analog electronics demonstrations  

## Tools & Software
- Arduino IDE  
- LM324 Datasheet  
- Breadboard-based prototyping  

## Future Enhancements
- LCD/OLED display for wind speed  
- Wireless data transmission (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)
